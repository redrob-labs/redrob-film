# macOS DMG window

What Finder shows when the DMG opens: a 660 × 400 pt background with the app icon and the
`Applications` link side by side. `package.sh` copies these files into the image; nothing here is
generated at build time, so the DMG still builds with `hdiutil makehybrid` (no mounted device, no
Finder scripting on CI, nothing extra installed in the signing job).

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `background-source.svg` | The layout: white ground, the Redrob primary lockup (`assets/brand/redrob-logo-primary.png`) followed by the name **Cut** (Pretendard 600, `ink-primary`), and a `gray-5` arrow from the app to `Applications`. The product name is live text here. |
| `background.svg` | The same with its text outlined and the lockup embedded byte for byte, so rendering needs no fonts: `usvg --skip-system-fonts --use-font-file Pretendard-SemiBold.otf --resources-dir . background-source.svg background.svg` (the design system ships Pretendard as woff2; convert it with fontTools first). |
| `background.tiff` | The background at 1x (660 × 400 px, 72 dpi) and 2x (1320 × 800 px, 144 dpi) in one HiDPI TIFF (16-colour palette, Deflate, sRGB). Goes to `.background/background.tiff`. |
| `dmg-layout.DS_Store` | Finder's view settings for the volume: window size, icon size 128, Redrob Film.app at (326, 205), `Applications` at (574, 205), and the background. Goes to `.DS_Store` in the image; named so it isn't mistaken for (or ignored like) a Finder-generated `.DS_Store`. |
| `generate.py` | Writes `background.tiff` and `dmg-layout.DS_Store` from the SVG and the layout above. |

## The volume name has no version

The mounted volume is called `Redrob Film`, not `Redrob Film <version>`. The layout points at the background
through an alias that includes the volume name, and Finder resolves it by that name: with a
versioned name the window keeps its size and icon positions but shows no background (tested).
The DMG file name (`redrob-film-<version>-macos-<arch>.dmg`) still carries the version.

## Rules

- **Finder draws the icon labels in black in light and dark mode** when a window has a background,
  so the area under both icons stays light (Paper).
- **Nothing goes inside the icon boxes:** artwork keeps 10 pt clear of each 128 pt icon box and of
  the label strip under it.

## Regenerate

Edit `background.svg` (or the layout constants in `generate.py`), then run, on any OS:

```sh
pip install 'pillow>=12' ds_store==1.3.3 mac_alias==2.2.3
python3 packaging/macos/dmg/generate.py   # needs resvg on PATH
```

Both outputs are byte-for-byte reproducible and carry nothing from the machine that ran it: the
SVG renders without any fonts, and `dmg-layout.DS_Store` is written from scratch, its background
alias holding only the volume name and `/.background/background.tiff`. If you add text to the SVG,
outline it (`usvg` from resvg converts text to paths). The window is 660 × 432 with Finder's 32 pt
title bar; the content area is 660 × 400.
